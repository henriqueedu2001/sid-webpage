Read the following sections in order to start developing.

## Install main Dependencies

- npm
- React
- NextJS
- Vercel CLI

## Setup environment variables

First of all, create a `.env` file sampled as the example `sample.env`. DO NOT change the variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL_PRODUCTION`, since the URL is constant. Defining the variable ENV as development or production will determine wich API you want to call. 

- [API repo](https://github.com/Erick-DAS/SID-api)

## Install dependencies

Run `npm i`

## Build

Run `npm run build`

## Run

Run `npm run dev`


Now that the NextJS server is running, one can access `http://localhost:3000` to visit the webpage.

`https://sid-webpage.vercel.app/` is the production public URL.
